### SYNCS HACK 2023

SYNCS HACK is a 24-hours hackathon in which teams of 1-5 compete to build innovative solutions - web application, games, physical solution - anything goes!

Our team's solution is a web application that allow users to ensure their trips are always environmentally friendly, by providing a helpful dashboard that shows the ecological impact of a trip to a given destination.

We built the app using Express for backend and NextJS for frontend.
